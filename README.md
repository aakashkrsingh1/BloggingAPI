# BloggingAPI
This is a a backend development project using Spring Boot. It aims to create all APIS for a Blogging Application.
We have to build a simple **Blogging Application**:

- Users should create, update, delete and list posts.
- Users should add, update, and delete comments on posts.
- Categorise the posts according to categories.
- New users should be able to Register to our application.
- Users should be able to log in to our application.
- Posts include one picture too.


## Resources for the Blogging Application

- USER
- CATEGORY
- POST
- COMMENT
- TAG


Note: Readme gets updated as we progress through the development.
